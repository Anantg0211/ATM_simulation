# Atm Simulation
hey my name is Anant, I am a tech enthusiast who have a huge willingness to learn new technologies in software world. I have build a ATM simulation dekstop app using Java swing, AWT classes, MySQL database and intellij IDE. Here you can simulate a ATM which is very similar to the real life ATM in functionalities and its GUI.

2000 Lines of code!!
